## Data Transformation

This file represents work done for an elections data services firm contracted to audit the processing of absentee ballots cast by military and overseas voters. Tools and technologies used include Python 3.9, Jupyter Notebooks, and the Python module pandas, primarily. 

Election data is collected at the county level with no real standards enforced, even within a state. This project required contacting election administrators, communicating what was required, and standardizing the data they provided so that it could be aggregated and analyzed downstream. The task required some back and forth with administrators with the goal of providing them with the information and tools necessary to produce the data to standard without outside assistance for the next election cycle. This is reflected in the inline comments as well as the presentation of the code.
